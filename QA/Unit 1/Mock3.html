The correct answer is: <strong>B</strong> - OTC traded interest rate and currency derivatives

<h3>Explanation</h3>
The insider dealing legislation relates specifically to abuses of information in respect of securities markets. This therefore includes instruments based on securities, such as stock index futures, share warrants and equity options. It does not relate to OTC markets, such as foreign exchange forward contracts. Additionally, the legislation does not cover assets with no secondary market, such as unit trusts.

<h3>Explanation</h3>
This is a difficult question which is not particularly well worded. Technically speaking clearing and settlement are two separate processes. 'Ensure legal obligations resulting from a trade are met' best describes settlement and 'recording and matching trades and maintaining positions' is closer to the process of clearing, which describes what happens before settlement.

The correct answer is: <strong>B</strong> - Harry, not Tom

</div>
<div class="test-answer-justification">
<h3>Explanation</h3>
Harry would be guilty of insider dealing. He was fully aware of the nature of the information and dealt anyway. 
Tom, although disclosing the information, reminded Harry not to deal. He could therefore use either of the following defences:
He could have passed on the information in the normal course of business, or he could use the defence that he did not expect the recipient to deal. Both of these defences would be consistent with reminding Harry not to deal.

<h3>Explanation</h3>
Withholding tax is, literally, the tax withheld by the country in which the income is earned. Despite this, tax will be due in the country of residence for the investor too. Often there is a tax treaty between nations allowing investors to claim a relief on the lower of the two tax liabilities. Clearly, if withholding tax is greater than the tax in the country of residence, there will be no refund.

Unregulated funds tend to be more aggressive in the market causing more market activity, higher fees but a potentially higher return (or bigger loss!). Regulated funds have more restrictions placed upon them including how much they can charge. This tends to lower overall cost of investment, but also potentially give lower returns.

An order driven system relies on sufficient liquidity for orders between buyers and sellers to be matched. If there is insufficient liquidity an order may not trade.
A quote-driven system is where a market maker provides a price to buy or sell the security. Therefore clients can always trade with a market maker - it might just be at an unfavourable price.

</div>

<div class="test-answer-justification">
<h3>Explanation</h3>
Our investor is very cautious, so equity is low on the list of appropriate investments. Although true that equity does generally increase over time, capital cannot be guaranteed even in a diversified investment such as an ETF. 
The guaranteed equity bond offered by national savings and investments, not only allows for exposure to gain on equity, but also protects the capital invested.
Although, in its purest sense, there is no initial outlay on a future, there is significant capital at risk, and cash calls can be made on the investor above any initial outlay.

The correct answer is: <strong>D</strong> - £7,000
</div>
</div>
<div class="test-answer-justification">
<h3>Explanation</h3>
Cumulative withdrawals of 5% of the original capital do not trigger chargeable events. 
£80,000 x 5% = £4,000 per year. After four years the cumulative total of potential withdrawals is £4,000 x four years = £16,000.
Actual withdrawals have been £2k + £3k + £4k = £9k. This means Emily has the potential to withdraw £16,000 - £9,000 = £7k without triggering a chargeable event.

A mutual fund that invests in debt would have its dividends treated as interest for purposes of tax. This would be the case with the Ajax OEIC. For the Americas' fund, we will calculate tax on its income as equity.
Americas' fund dividend tax:  £780 / 0.9 x 22.5% = £195.
Ajax OEIC dividend tax = £140 / 0.8 x 20% = £35.

<h3>Explanation</h3>
Fee-based advice provides more clarity to the investor on the cost of advice. With commission-based advice, this cost can be hidden to the client. There is no guarantee that the advice given will be better when using a fee-based advisor, but it does eliminate the advisor recommending the products or provider that offer the best commissions (product/provider bias).

<h2>Question 80</h2>
<div class="test-question-body">
<span class="test-question-id">[1054061]</span>
<span class="test-question-text">Mr Faversham has recently passed away. He leaves a wife (Felicity Faversham) and three 	sons (Jon, James and Jeffro). Ten years ago, Mr Faverhsam placed 25% of his estate into trust for 	his three grandchildren (Anna, Anne and Anjolina) and they will have access to this on thei 	twenty-first birthdays. The country house (Faversham Hall) passed directly to Felicity 	Faversham. Mr Faversham's remaining assets passed to his sons, as 	stipulated through Mr Faversham's will that is being handled by the law firm Pembers and 	Ross. 
Pembers and Ross have been established since 1846 and have handled the Faverhsam business since Mr Faversham's grandfather made a fortune in coal. As part of the will, the firm is holding a number of assets, including shares which they will distribute to the brothers on completion. However, James Faversham is concerned about tax issues in relation to the transfer.
Jon Faversham owns a tyre retread business, which is struggling in the current economic climate. He and his wife Sarah have recently approached Pembers and Ross, as they are keen to encourage a swift resolution of the will, as he is concerned about cash flow in his business and feels that he may need to file for bankruptcy if he does not receive his inheritance soon. 
A friend of Jeffro Faversham has recently inherited £500,000 and needs investment advice.  Jeffro has been happy with the helpfulness of the partners at the firm and recommends them to his friend.
Pembers and Ross, in administering the will, are providing safe custody of the assets for the Faversham family. They are also, potentially, about to give investment advice to the friend of Jeffro. From a regulatory perspective, how will this be treated?</span>

The correct answer is: <strong>D</strong> - Pembers and Ross need to be authorised for the advice, but not for the custody
</div>
</div>
<div class="test-answer-justification">
<h3>Explanation</h3>
As the custodian services are provided as incidental business to execution of the will, they can provide these under their exemption as a DPB. However, they would need to be authorised to provide investment advice as a core activity.

<h3>Explanation</h3>
Derivatives should be valued on fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). In this way they are marked to market at the time of producing the financial statements and any profit or loss, realised or unrealised, is reflected in the profit and loss account. Derivative positions used as a hedge are not be covered under IAS39, because, in general, a derivative used as a hedge will be held to delivery and therefore its realisable value. For this reason, the price that was agreed on the creation of the contract will be value used on the financial statements.
