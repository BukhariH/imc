The order execution policy sets out how a firm will achieve best execution. Therefore, if the firm adheres to this, they fulfil best execution. The reference to retail clients is irrelevant to the question, as this would also apply to professional clients.

<div class="test-answer-actual">
The correct answer is: <strong>B</strong> - Both Mary and Angela are saving to meet real liabilities
</div>
</div>
<div class="test-answer-justification">
<h3>Explanation</h3>
Most of this is thinking about the time horizons of the investors. 
Angela obviously has the longer horizon. This would suggest a greater willingness to take on risk, and a greater emphasis on real investments and growth.
Mary has a shorter investment horizon. This suggests less willingness to take on risk. Nevertheless, her potential liability is still some way in the future, so the impact of inflation needs to be considered. 
Angela is less concerned about the tax implications of the investments, as she is allocating them within her pension, where they would be tax exempt. Tax will be a concern to Mary; income tax during the life of the investment and capital gains tax on maturity of the investment.

The correct answer is: <strong>B</strong> - No IHT is due, and Margaret receives 80% of Henry's nil-rate band
</div>
</div>
<div class="test-answer-justification">
<h3>Explanation</h3>
The transfer between spouses is totally exempt from IHT and would not be included in the estate. This means the estate is valued at £65,000 only, which is well below the nil-rate band, so clearly no IHT is due. However, the £65,000 gift on death is part of the estate and uses up some of the nil-rate band:
£65,000 / £325,000 x 100 = 20%
This leaves 80% of the nil-rate band remaining, which can be passed on to Margaret.

The correct answer is: <strong>B</strong> - Interest in possession trust

<div class="test-answer-justification">
<h3>Explanation</h3>
An interest in possession trust would allow Dwayne to place his assets in trust. The income generated can be handed over to his wife, the life interest, in order to support her after his death. However, the life interest cannot touch the assets themselves. On the death of the life interest, the assets pass in their entirety to another beneficiary, referred to as the remainderman.

The main factor used in identifying a politically exposed person (PEP) is their vulnerability to corruption. According to JMLSG Guidance this includes persons who are: heads of state, heads of government and ministers; members of parliaments; members of supreme courts, or of other high-level judicial bodies whose decisions are not generally subject to further appeal; members of courts of auditors or of the boards of central banks; ambassadors, and high-ranking officers in the armed forces; and members of the administrative, management or supervisory boards of State-owned enterprises. 
These categories also include direct family members of the above, such as spouse, children and parents. They do not, however, include middle-ranking or more junior officials.

The basic rate band ends at £31,865. Marie's gain moves beyond this band. For this reason she will be taxed on the gain partly at the basic rate (18%) and partly at the higher rate (28%).
The first £1,865 of the gain is taxed at 18%: £1,865 x 0.18 = £335.70
The remaining £2,135 is taxed at 28%: £2,135 x 0.28 = £597.80

Saliy is a self-employed contractor earning approximately £60,000 a year, and Dahir works at a university as a lab technician earning £20,000 per year. 
They own a variety of investments and usually meet with their financial advisor semi-annually. Saliy owns £50,000 of shares, which she bought six years ago for £5,000. In the previous fiscal year, she sold these shares to Dahir for £20,000 and has repurchased them this year for £25,000. 
In this fiscal year Saliy, transferred £30,000NV of gilts with a 5% coupon to Dahir. 
He has decided to sell them six months into the fiscal year. They are currently trading at PAR.
The couple are planning to move house and have had an offer accepted on a house they like at £250,000 and are moving towards completion. They have agreed to sell their cottage to a Mr and Mrs Wilson at its current value. This will be the first home that the Wilson's have owned.

The correct answer is: <strong>B</strong> - £3,920
</div>
</div>
<div class="test-answer-justification">
<h3>Explanation</h3>
As she had sold the shares to her husband in the previous fiscal year and repurchased them in this fiscal year, she can benefit from the practice of bed and spouse, which allows her to use her CGT allowances on each of these sales. This means that any prior gains or losses would have been settled at the previous sale, so she is only liable for CGT since the repurchase.
(Disposal - cost of purchase - allowance) X CGT rate
(£50,000 - £25,000 - £11,000) X 0.28 = £3,920
